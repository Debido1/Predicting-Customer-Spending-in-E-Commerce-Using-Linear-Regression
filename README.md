# Predicting-Customer-Spending-in-E-Commerce-Using-Linear-Regression
The goal of this Analysis is to Know if the E-Commerce store should focus their efforts on their mobile app or website. and also to analyzes e-commerce customer behavior to predict yearly spending using Linear Regression.

# Dataset Overview

In this project, I explored an e-commerce dataset to understand customer behavior and predict their yearly spending. The dataset includes:  
- Average session length  
- Time spent on app  
- Time spent on website  
- Length of membership  

The target variable is **Yearly Amount Spent** (how much each customer spends in a year).

## Goals of the Project  
I. Find out whether the company should focus more on the **mobile app** or the **website**.  
II. Use a **Linear Regression model** to predict customer yearly spending. 

## Project Structure 
1. Looked at the data and cleaned it.  
2. Explored relationships between features (like app usage vs. website usage).  
3. Built a linear regression model with Scikit-Learn.  
4. Evaluated the model with metrics like RÂ² and error scores.  
5. Shared insights on customer behavior and spending patterns.
